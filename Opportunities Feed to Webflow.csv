levels of gas supply chain and liquid fuels is looking for partners 
interested in distribution services agreements. The company is also open to 
services agreements, commercial agency agreements and subcontracting. The 
process optimization is done by collecting data in time through telemetry 
equipment (sensors, meters, radio communication modules and 2G and 3G 
communication modules) that provides data recording, automatic meter 
reading and sending alarms. These devices may be connected to different 
types of sensors, by cable or radio, via RTU (Radio Transmitter Unit). With 
RTU is possible to create a wireless mesh network and thereby transmitting 
data between RTUs. This network increases solution’s coverage area through 
the use of a single central unit equipped with mobile communications. The 
received data is saved and sent to the data management software developed 
by the Portuguese company, that provides a set of detailed data and 
indicators for a more efficient distribution, transport gas storage and 
liquid fuels. This software has a web page interface or platform can be 
integrated into enterprise resource planning (ERP) company. The main 
applications consist of liquefied propane gas (LPG) and oil tank remote 
monitoring, cathodic protection monitoring of buried deposits, automatic 
meter reading and gas stock management and liquid fuels, allowing companies 
to manage more efficiently its gas and LPG tanks parks. Currently, M2M

comsumption and heating oil, in real time, as well as, comfort parameters 
(temperature and relative humidity) and remotely control the electrical 
equipment through a web page or mobile applications. The solution for smart 
homes incorporates telemetry features of LPG tanks and electricity meters, 
with smart plugs, which allow monitoring and control each device 
individually. The concept will evolve for telemetry heating and diesel 
lubricants, as well as smoke detectors, gas leaks and thermostats and 
continuously develop the improvement of current user interfaces. This 
solution was developed based on information and communications technologies 
(ICT) and IoT, an experience that incorporates technologies associated with 
the concept that allow anyone to connect any equipment coupled to sensors 
creating a mesh network, aimed at transferring signals and data through 
two-way communications without requiring human intervention. Being the 
information stored in a hub, which is connected to the router’s home allows 
data to be sent via Internet to the company’s cloud, which will be 
processed, treated, stored and made available to the end user through the 
portal and associated applications.","The company is in a stage that has partners and local stakeholders,

internationalization strategy – dedicated to commercialize their products, 
always looking for business cooperation on markets where it doesn’t have 
subsidiaries present in form of subcontracting, to perform the installation

purposes. In summer it can be used as a shadow pavilion, expo-dome, seating 
area or greenhouse. During winter it can be used as greenhouse for 
seedlings. All these features can be obtained by using coverage kits. The 
geodome was designed as a DIY “do it yourself” product, made of small, 
lightweight, compatible modules. This enables the product reconfiguration 
depending on the season or purpose. The product is designed using a simple 
philosophy: to be easily installed in a short time without using 
specialized tools. All structures are made of softwood modules treated 
through immersion against fungus and wood decay and ready to be used for a 
wide range of applications. The Romanian company is looking for companies, 
mainly from the gardening sector, interested to become distributors for 
this product. Large retailers having gardening sector in their store are 
also potential partners.","The geodome is a safe construction, stable strong and solid. Due to its 
shape, the geodesic dome is a stable construction as the pressure applied 
on it is distributed (to a certain degree) around the entire structure. 
Being comprised of triangles, it has a unique stability, since the triangle 
is the only polygon that keeps its shape by nature. The geodome structures

provide the products under the exclusive contract with the Sake breweries

the sales to the trading company and the trading company takes advantage of 
it in order to select items for the exports. It leads the tendency of the 
limited selections being weigh on the brewer’s name or the margin rate.

https://www.enterprise-europe.co.uk/opportunities/BOUK20151117005,"Company: This company, which is one of the UKs leading battery specialists, 
was incorporated in 1952 as a manufacturer of lead acid batteries. It is no 
longer producing batteries, but since the cessation of manufacturing, the 
company has developed into one of the largest distributors of batteries in 
the UK with a total warehousing capacity of 24,000 sq ft (2,230 sq m). The 
company has a substantial knowledge base on batteries, their manufacture, 
distribution, application and have extensive contacts within the industry. 
Product: The company has developed a product for which it seeks 
distributors in Germany, France, Belgium and Spain. The product is an 
environmentally responsible device for testing the viability of small 
domestic batteries in the home, office or commercial premises. It can test 
a variety of batteries including AA, AAA, C and D. It consists of a battery 
testing device that indicates if the battery has low, moderate or good 
power output and an integrated disposal container for spent batteries. This 
disposal container can hold up to a year’s worth of domestic household 
waste batteries. This product has been developed and designed in the UK 
with patent protection. The product has a very clear and clever packaging 
that allows multiple packs to be placed together for display in a small 
space for marketing purposes in retail outlets. Product sales 
opportunities: There are investigations by leading universities and through 
the hands-on testing of disposed batteries at supermarket bins which 
confirm the large scale disposal of batteries which are not spent. Up to 
40% of disposed batteries could still be used; this is environmentally 
damaging and represents a potential for cost savings by a simple testing 
method before disposal – such as is provided by this device. The European 
Union Battery Directive is legislation in force to increase battery 
recycling, setting targets for waste reduction and raising future awareness 
with the public and business. This is having an effect with larger public 
organisations, which buy the company’s product in large volume in order to 
comply to the EU legislation, or to their own new environmental recycling 
policies. There are cost savings to every household and business by not 
disposing of batteries that are otherwise good to use. This cost saving can 
be calculated from the average number of batteries used per year as a 
compelling sales argument and the product can be shown to pay for itself. 
Current and potential customers Include: • High street retailers and 
supermarkets. • Organisations with high battery use as hospitals, schools 
and government departments. • Businesses in various sectors such as garden 
centres, hardware stores and stationery outlets. • Domestic households. • 
TV shopping channels. • Environmental and renewable energy organisations. • 
Recycling in poorer nations can result in income for individuals with these 
products. Current distribution: This product is already being sold directly 
into Europe and further afield through distributors. Overall the product is 
currently sold within 12 countries. The company now seeks to develop a 
strong distribution network of long-term partners to take advantage of the 
changing consumer awareness of the cost savings and environmental benefits 
of reduced battery wastage.","Distributors who have access and sell into the some of the following groups

capitalising upon commercial opportunities as they arose. In 2006 the 
company reorganised its array of products and capabilities into three 
divisions - fire and security, mouldings and tool making and precision 
engineering. The company’s capability in all of these areas makes it unique 
in the security field. The company can offer expertise and capabilities in 
design, tooling, injection moulding, packaging and can provide warehousing 
all under one roof. This allows competitive pricing, leading-edge design 
and bespoke work to be undertaken. Products: Fire and security products 
include magnetic contacts, junction boxes, panic buttons, internal 
sounders, call points, and access controls for activating fire or security 
alarms. The company actually leads the UK market in three products; 
magnetic contacts, junction boxes and panic buttons. These products comply 
with EU standards and legislation and are compatible with the 
market-leading fire and security control panels from other manufacturers. A 
product catalogue is available upon request, but potential distributors 
should please note that the company's in-house capabilities enable it to 
also offer a large possible range of bespoke products for customers who 
require different specifications or aesthetics. This can range from 
electronic component values, wiring lengths through to simple branding. The 
company has developed expertise in security product design from years in 
the sector and has specialist engineers working at a very high level in 
magnetics. As a result of its design & manufacturing expertise and product 
quality the company has become the first choice as an original equipment 
manufacturer (O.E.M.) for many leading security companies such as: Chubb, 
Honeywell, Tyco, ADI, Siemens, UTC. The company owns extensive warehousing 
facilities so product can be made in large batches and stored for customer 
call-off as needed. This provides substantial customer benefits including 
lower pricing, lower insurance, lower requirement for warehousing capacity 
and increased flexibility. Offer: This company has an extensive network of 
distributors and currently exports to over 30 different countries, mainly 
through just one distributor in each country. The company also sells to 
other UK companies who then sell into South America. It is very important

company invites EOIs from prospective distributor partners based in all EEN 
countries and is particularly also interested in EOIs from prospective 
distribution partners in Russia. Customers for distributors are likely to 
include security product supply companies wishing to expand their product 
range, security system installation companies, end-user companies wishing 
to install their own fire/security systems, DIY stores and other retailers. 
Potential distribution partners' sales channels may include online-based 
sales, 'real world' or high street store based sales, travelling sales 
force or any mix of these channels.","Ideal partners will be general electrical distributors or specialist 
fire/security alarm product distributors. Several years of relevant 
distribution experience will be required and ideally able to provide 
evidence of successful distribution of similar products. Potential partners

conditions inside poultry houses, increasing flock health and growth ratios 
by helping to reduce the detrimental effects associated with heat or cold 
stress, gas build-up, biological contaminants and cross infection. The foil 
membrane can be draped either over or under the poultry house rafters, 
resulting in more than 96% of the radiating energy will being blocked

fitted to walls and can act as a vapour barrier helping to stop the ingress 
of outside humidity . The product reflects in upwards of 96% of the 
infrared energy striking its tarnish resistant surface. The liner’s 
surfaces have a low emissivity of only 0.045. Increased stress on indoor 
reared birds usually results in longer production cycles and higher feed 
input for a given growth rate or egg laying capacity. During hot weather, 
heat stress caused by infrared energy from the sun striking the poultry 
house roof will exacerbate the problem. The sun's heat conducts through the 
roof then radiates directly from its underside as infrared energy onto the 
birds below. The additional heat also increases harmful gasses by 
facilitating microbe action in the litter. In hot climates, the most 
critical time of year for egg yields and growing times is in the heat of 
summer when temperatures easily exceed 27ºC. In colder and temperate 
climates maintaining heat in the cooler months is the main criteria. 
Control of the poultry house environment by installing the membrane, 
growing times for flocks can be decreased and bio security systems 
enhanced. In cold climates 30% of energy costs can be saved, when the foil

collectors, such as high temperatures. PTC converts the solar irradiation 
into useful heat energy by concentrating every single solar beam up to 80

can also enable steam generation by solar energy, which is used for 
cooling. This possibility - to enable cooling using solar energy - is 
company's innovation. Automated tracking system enables the collectors to 
track the sun from sunrise to sunset and the light-weighted and robust 
collector design assures both ground and roof installation. The systems can 
be installed anywhere without the costs of logistics and easily integrated 
into the existing energy supply structure. The operational costs are very 
low, because of the use of eco-friendly solar energy. Being in possession

wireless. It may also be connected (by Ethernet, TCP/IP) to the 
manufacturer server to update the software, receiving failures alarms and 
remote diagnose for possible failures. In this way, the plant manager can 
have remote information in real time about the functioning and control it 
with several automations level according to their needs and/or choices. All 
of this is made possible by the powerful microprocessor included in the

brine output valves, turning on the water pumps and the control of the 
normal use of the plant (filling the permeate water deposit and switching 
to production), including membrane filling with permeate water in the 
stopping procedure. The console screen will show operating and failure 
status indicators, which constitutes an innovation for plants with minimum 
automation. 2. The second automation level also permits the measuring of 
the flow and an output to the high-pressure pump speed variator, an 
essential element for an appropriate flow regulation. 3. The third 
automation level enables pressure measurement through the installation of 
pressure sensors (for example in the input and output of pumps, membranes 
and filters…). 4. The fourth automation level enables the valves control, 
for their on-site operation as well as their remote control through an 
SCADA via Ethernet. This is especially useful with the regulation valves.

work passively or actively, dependent on ability. This makes the equipment

people living with conditions such as multiple sclerosis, fibromyalgia and 
post-stroke patients. The current suite of 15 machines provide safe 
exercise to all the major muscle and joint groups, helping to re-train 
muscle patterns, whilst at the same time stimulating the cardiovascular 
system to improve circulation. The machines are currently sold in the UK 
directly to public and private sector leisure centres, via independent 
retailers, or to the healthcare and rehabilitation sector. The organisation

the company, allows damage-free processing by extremely low ion energies 
(lower than 1 eV) and conformal deposition of conductive and isolating 
films at high rate and low stress (lower than 50 megapascal). Usage of this

in design and production of a wide range of high-tech and high performance 
ultrasonic transducers for general-purpose flaw detectors and thickness 
gauges. At present, the company staff is of 11 people. The company's 
employees have extensive experience in scientific, technical and economic 
and marketing activities in the implementation of high-tech projects. 
Company Director is Ph.D., has extensive experience in the field of 
ultrasonic non-destructive testing. The company has a lot of successful 
projects, including innovation. The company has five existing Certificates 
of Rosstandart on the statement like measuring instruments and ISO 
9001-2015. Main directions of activity: development and production of 
equipment for ultrasonic nondestructive testing, accessories for ultrasonic 
nondestructive testing. Each transducer is made to a high standard in 
accordance with acoustic, electrical and mechanical parameters. 
Transmitters are tested at each stage of production. Converters are 
available with different connectors, body configurations and sizes of the 
piezoelectric elements. Calibration blocks are used for calibration of 
ultrasonic thickness gauges and ultrasonic flaw detectors. They have many 
shapes and sizes. Types of calibration blocks depend on the industry for 
the application and the shape of the objects of control. The company can 
produce blocks for any calibration standards of different materials sized 
reflectors up to 0.05 mm. Calibration blocks are manufactured according to 
normative documents or drawings of the customer within 2 months. 
Piezoelectric transducers are in stock. For series orders production time 
for transducers is up to 1 month. Development of non-standard transducers 
on the customer's requirements (from 30 pieces series) is possible. Terms 
of development is 2 months; then they are tested by a customer. Production 
of series products is up to 1 month. Calibration blocks and converters are 
used for non-destructive testing in order to detect defects in metal body 
and plastic welds in the following industries: thermal energy; nuclear 
power; oil and gas industry; oil drilling equipment; load capacity 
mechanisms; technological pipelines; pipelines made of polyethylene; 
vessels and apparatuses working under pressure; construction (fencing

vertical, ""working"" wall corner reflector used micro milling. Increased 
service life achieved by the application of anti-corrosion coating. 
Production of inclined transducers combined with wear resistant tread is 
realized through the use of alumina ceramics with additives. These 
additives provide the required acoustic characteristics. For this purpose, 
research and established manufacturing transducers were conducted. 
Parameters transducers (especially, sensitivity) is not only affected, but 
even improved compared to conventional converters. The same pottery was 
used in the manufacture of transducers used in the control of railways (for 
direct and oblique transducers for combined transducers). Applied 
technologies allow for control of the weld object thickness from 2 mm. 
Similar converters from other manufacturers allow control facilities with a 
thickness from 4mm. At production of chordate converters it is used 
3D-design, which provides the focus of the ultrasonic beam and reducing the 
number of false signals. The design increases the service life. In 
converters ""memory chips"" are used to reduction of time of control of an 
electro-acoustic path. Information from converters is included in all 
electronic reports on control. The chip is used with some types of 
defectoscopes where there is the corresponding reader. These technologies 
will help to achieve the following objectives: wearproof materials raise 
service life of converters at 15-20 times that leads to decrease in 
expenses of the diagnosing departments and the companies; Use of chordate 
converters increases productivity, reduces zones of cleaning of a welded 
seam, increases probability of determination of defects. Use of the 
separate combined converters will allow to reveal defects in welded seams 
of thin-walled products from materials with big attenuation (for example, 
from the titan).",Already on the market,"Patents granted,Trade Marks",Russian manufacture of equipment for ultrasonic nondestructive testing is looking for distributors and partners for manufacturing agreement or distribution.,Russia,http://www.tradeaccelerator.co.uk/country-guide/import-export-to-Russia,Supplier,OP10350,Import,Import-OP10350-Supplier-from-Russia,BORU20160819003,Enterprise Europe Network,Alibaba Alternative Supplier from Russia,Value Unknown

rotary welding by friction is joint motion of two components during the 
action of the pressure power. One centred coaxial part of a welded 
component rotates and the other is still. The pressure power acts on one of 
the pieces, and this way the fraction power is originated. Feeding 
mechanical energy is changing into thermal energy at substantially high 
efficiency. At first, both surfaces are being levelled by high specific 
pressure and then they are being deformed. Next the deep surface pull-out 
occurs at the construction and destruction of micro welds, plus strong 
heating and marked longitude deformation. At the same time the formation of 
a characteristic flash happens. Main advantages of used process: - 
different types of material can be welded - excellent quality of the 
welding point - prevention of melting because of poor heat flow The company 
provides its products and services on the basis of more than 20 years 
experience. The SME is albe to process requirements of customers based on

A new system brings the novel UCNP (upconverting nanoparticles) technology 
into the life science laboratory. Consisting of UCNPs together with a 
microplate reader the system is the first of its kind in the world and 
offers many benefits over traditional label technologies. With UCNPs by 
converting near-infrared radiation (NIR) into visible light the emission 
signal can be measured free of autofluorescence and scattered excitation 
light. The emission signal comes from lanthanide ions being very stable 
with a long lifetime (from µs to ms). These two factors render the 
instrumentation simple, yet robust. With the company's scientific 
collaborators it provides the option of measuring up-converting 
nanoparticles. This offers a possibility to achieve a more than two orders

handicapped, the small independent robotic system enables people with a 
disability or the elderly to open self-closing entrance doors through a 
mobile application/remote control. It provides an answer to the real 
necessity of the handicapped population, as well as to the pressing need 
created by both legislature requiring accessibility of public buildings and 
the growing elderly population. The company works closely with an NGO 
dedicated to finding individual solutions for varied patients’ needs, 
providing marketable solutions to serve the wider handicapped population. 
The robot (141x358x231mm), operated through a free phone application or 
remote control, simply attaches to the bottom of the door with double sided 
adhesive strips, without the need for technical experience or special 
equipment (no professional installation required). It does not require any 
changes to be made to the door or the crossbar, nor changes to the 
electrical infrastructure. The robot is run by rechargeable batteries 
(supplied with charger) that deliver sufficient power for many weeks. The 
Door Opener is compatible with the vast majority of both external and 
internal doors, both with and without hydraulic or spring door closing 
mechanisms. The robot simply, safely and quietly opens the door, enabling 
easy access - waiting until the opening is clear before closing the door 
back automatically. The Door Opener robot and smart phone application 
provides a much needed solution for accessibility in buildings where this 
requirement was not taken into consideration during the initial planning 
and construction. As no electrical connection is needed, and there is no 
need to replace either the door or doorframe, the solution can be easily 
installed without the need for expensive renovations. Today, accessibility 
is required by law in the majority of public as well as many private 
buildings, and all too many doors do not meet the standard requirements.

available options. The developers are seeking door manufacturers for 
strategic partnerships, to include the robot as an add-on to the doors they 
sell and install. Connections with organizations promoting accessibility

use of the robot in key prominent public buildings so as to promote its 
use. Distributors with access to these markets are sought as well for 
strategic partnership to help build the international marketing strategy,

the bottom of the door (by clicking on “open” on the APP they see all doors

have easy access and entry to the building/room. If they do not already 
have the application, the QR code displayed on the Door Opener will allow 
them to quickly download the APP. The robot is simple to install and does 
not require any electrical wiring (it is operated by a rechargeable 
battery), or renovations to the door, making it an easy to use solution for 
almost any door, external or internal. Consisting of an electric drive 
mechanism with two DC brush motors, it needs only a simple initial 
calibration making the system fully customizable to the needs and the type 
of door. The advanced control system allows for minimal power consumption 
and long battery life between charges. BLE communication protocol is used 
for to assure security, low power consumption and reliability. When the 
system is not engaged, the drive pulley is disconnected from the ground and 
the unit does not interface with the normal movement of the door, 
preventing erosion and system wear. The system is equipped with a smart 
safety mechanism to prevent injury to the user and/or passers-by with an 
electronic protection mechanism that immediately stops the progression of 
the door when the driving pulley encounters any obstacle, and a warning 
beep when opening/closing the door. Unlike other systems, the Door Opener 
does not require installation, changing the door structure, door frame and 
electrical work - that make the other solutions very costly. And unlike the 
other solutions, the Door Opener is both portable and removable.",Available for demonstration,Patent(s) applied for but not yet granted,"Door manufacturers as well as organizations active in promoting accessibility are sought to bring to market a small robotic Door Opener activated through a smart phone - providing simple access for handicap/wheelchair bound, elderly and others",Israel,http://www.tradeaccelerator.co.uk/country-guide/import-export-to-Israel,Supplier,OP10510,Import,Import-OP10510-Supplier-from-Israel,BOIL20170711002,Enterprise Europe Network,Alibaba Alternative Supplier from Israel,Value Unknown

increase the volume of the mixture (overrun): to reduce the rate from 120% 
to 40%. This low amount of air is unusually found in commercial ice cream 
and the result is a creamier and smoother gelato with a more intense 
fragrance and that will last longer. The product undergoes an ultra-fast 
freezing process where it reaches -12°C in one hour. The temperature drop 
gives tone to the texture and confers a long-term preservation. The company 
invests in the future, respects the environment and believes in sustainable 
development. Since the freezing techniques require a sizeable amount of 
energy, the company decided to mount a 81Kw photovoltaic system on its roof 
to produce clean energy, Thereby allows a 30% energy saving with respect to 
the company's needs. A plate heat exchanger has been ecployed accordingly. 
This is a water dosage automatic system placed in the HTST (High 
Temperature Short Time) system, the heart of the production process. The 
energy that is produced during the heating of the ice cream mixture is in 
part delivered to heat up water during the cooling down phase. Special 
attention is paid to the use of partially biodegradable material for the 
packaging, to the reduction of packings to the bare necessities and to the

with integrated encoder feedback. It also automatically controls the motor 
current according to loads. Furthermore, it utilizes a high-resolution 
encoder to update the motor position every 25 micro seconds Thus, heat from

PROFINET(Process Field Net) and EtherCAT provided by well-known German 
companies for automation, the company became aware of the rapid changes in 
this industrial structure in Korea and other countries with advanced 
automation industry. At that time, there was no closed loop stepping system 
based on EtherCAT network. To lead another decade of the closed loop 
stepper system market, the company has developed closed loop stepper motor 
and drive based on EtherCAT. It adopts the servo control method which 
eliminates stalling through an innovative closed loop control algorithm 
with integrated encoder feedback. It also automatically controls the motor 
current according to loads. Furthermore, it utilizes a high-resolution 
encoder to update the motor position every 25 micro seconds Thus, heat from 
the motor and drive is minimized, which helps reduce energy usage. Lastly, 
acceleration and deceleration characteristics as well as the motor torque 
can be improved by a setting called Run current (up to 150%) via 
parameters. The company has signed the exclusive sales agreement for the 
product based on the ODM(Original Development Manufacturing) contract with 
a US global leading company, Parker. Other than that, additional 
OEM(Original Equipment Manufacturing)/ODM business with the EtherCAT master 
companies and Asian companies has been in process. The company hopes to 
cooperate with EU companies that manufactures or sells factory automation 
products to their customers under commercial agency, and distribution 
service agreement.","The company’s closed loop stepping motor system supports high speed 
ethernet(100Mbps full-duplex)-based fieldbus(an industrial network system 
for real-time distributed control). The company successfully developed 
EtherCAT(Ethernet Control Automation Technology) based closed loop stepper 
motor and drive, and it is the first closed loop stepper solution which 
allows full real-time control. The company’s closed loop stepping motor 
system has the following advantages over open loop control stepping drive; 
1. Reliable positioning without loss of synchronism 2. Holds stable 
position and automatically recovers to the original position even after 
experiencing positioning error due to external forces, such as mechanical 
vibration or vertical positional holding 3. Utilizes 100% of the full range 
of rated motor torque, contrary to a conventional open loop stepping driver 
that can use up to 50% of the rated motor torque due to the loss of 
synchronism 4. Operates at high speed due to load-dependent current 
control. 5. Open loop stepper drivers use a constant current control at all 
speed ranges without considering load variations Advantages over servo 
motor controller 1. No gain tuning(automatic adjustment of gain in response 
to a load change) 2. Maintains a stable holding position without 
oscillation after completing positioning. 3. Fast positioning due to the 
independent control by on-board DSP 4. Continuous operation during rapid 
short-stroke movement due to instantaneous positioning",Already on the market,Exclusive Rights,A Korean company is looking for distributors or agents for their closed loop stepping motor system used in factory automation,South Korea,http://www.tradeaccelerator.co.uk/country-guide/import-export-to-South-Korea,Supplier,OP10533,Import,Import-OP10533-Supplier-from-South Korea,BOKR20170808001,Enterprise Europe Network,Alibaba Alternative Supplier from South Korea,Value Unknown

(4.9 KW / h). By request of the buyer, pellets can be packed in 15 kg bags 
or in big bags of different sizes. The company sells its products within 
the Russian Federation and has experience of collaboration with German 
companies. The Russian company is interested in looking for partners among 
retail and wholesale networks to conclude distribution services agreement. 
Under the agreement the company will supply regularly biofuel pellets of 
hiqh quality at reasonable prices and a potential partner will promote, 
sell or resell, and distribute products of the company among retail 
networks and individual consumers for further use. The expected result of 
cooperation is long-standing cooperation under the terms which are 
beneficial for both the company and the partner. Size and period of the 
delivery will be discussed after the first contact.","- The main advantage of biofuel pellets is a higher rate of heat transfer 
as compared to clippings and planking, so biofuel pellets are more 
effective. - Such pellets have a higher wood fire resistance, thus one may 
store such pellets close to the house. - There is low ash content and 
carbon dioxide content (less than 0.7%) as compared to coal. Thus, use of 
fuel pellets is considered more cost-efficient. Due to a lower emission 
level during burning, such pellets are environmentally friendly.",Already on the market,Patents granted,Russian fuel pellets producer looks for distributors,Russia,http://www.tradeaccelerator.co.uk/country-guide/import-export-to-Russia,Supplier,OP10601,Import,Import-OP10601-Supplier-from-Russia,BORU20160906009,Enterprise Europe Network,Alibaba Alternative Supplier from Russia,Value Unknown

products: - Round pearl rice: ideal for all types of rice recipes (both pan

it takes longer to be overcooked, keeping all the flavours of the dish. 
Cooking time: between 15 and 17 minutes. - Bright semilong rice: excellent 
for salads, paella or other dishes with the sauce served separately. The 
semi-long grain rice absorbs less juice during the cooking process, thus it 
is looser. Once cooked, it takes longer to be overcooked. . Cooking time: 
between 18 and 20 minutes. - Brown rice: considered more natural because it 
removes the outer husk and bypasses any bleaching process. One of the few

fibre, minerals and vitamins B1, B6 and E. The key to the acquisition of

https://www.enterprise-europe.co.uk/opportunities/BOIT20170512001,"This well-established Italian company is an over 30-year-old manufacturer 
of adhesives for ceramics and chemical products for the construction 
sector. In particular, the company manufactures: - substrate products and 
treatments; - adhesives for ceramic tiles and natural stones; - sealants 
for joints; - plasters, mortars and high-performance finishes; - special 
mortars and products; - insulation system; bio line with natural lime; - 
products for restoration and waterproofing; - restoration mortars and 
photocatalytic products. In addition to these products, the company has 
recently added to its product portfolio an innovative photocatalytic 
mineral based paint. This new paint (for interior and exterior use) is 
manufactured with a patented photocatalytic principle which can reduce 
organic and inorganic pollutants in the air. It has self-cleaning and 
anti-mold properties, purifying the air by smog, smells, viruses and 
bacteria. Its effectiveness has been thoroughly tested and certified by 
important independent research centers (Italian National Research 
Council-CNR, Italian National Institute for Environmental Protection and 
Research-Ispra, etc.). In particular, tests carried out in recent years 
with applications in urban settings have shown (outside the optimal 
conditions of the laboratory) a significant ability to reduce pollutants, 
between 20% and 70%, depending on atmosphere and light conditions. This is 
possible thanks to what has been called ""urban photocatalysis"": in the 
presence of air and light, a natural process of oxidization is created on 
visible urban surfaces treated with the patented photocatalytic principle 
which leads to the decomposition of organic and inorganic substances 
present in urban areas. In particular, the photocatalytic reaction which 
occurs on the surface of materials treated with the said principle 
transforms pollutants into salts which have no impact on the environment 
and health. Laboratory tests have also shown that just 3 minutes of 
exposure to the sun is sufficient to obtain a reduction in polluting agents 
of up to 75%. Besides, a recent report has also shown the most significant 
results of laboratory tests fully demonstrating the bacteriostatic and 
anti-algae effect of the materials manufactured with the said patented 
photocatalytic principle, which, therefore, can also be effectively used on 
the inner surfaces of public places (e.g. hospitals) to favor the 
decontamination of the relating environments. The company is the Italian 
licensee holder of this photocatalytic principle which has been launched in 
2006, after 10 years of research and testing by one of the largest cement 
producers in the world. Thanks to the extreme flexibility of its 
manufacturing capabilities and the long time experience in the sector, the 
company manufactures under both its own brand and private label. When 
producing under private label, the company is also able to offer 
formulation and manufacture of special construction products in customized 
packaging. Furthermore, since 2010, this ambitious company has also been 
providing consulting services to other companies in the construction 
products sector, such as: raw material analysis, formulation of products, 
quality control and CE marking, training for technical and commercial 
staff, assistance to the start-up of new companies in the construction 
products sector in other countries. The company is already engaged in 
transnational cooperation (Malta, Belgium, Germany, Canada, Lebanon, 
Brazil, China, India) and is now looking to further expand internationally.

the water and can save up to 90% on water, energy and CO2 emissions. The 
system creates a water flow out of a 40 cm wellness shower, which provides 
40 littres per minute, while only using 1-2 litre water per minute. A 
regular shower would use 40 liters per minute. The water is pushed by the 
pump through the Ultra Violet disinfection and driven towards the wellness 
shower. Per minute, 1-2 littre of fresh hot water is added in order to 
maintain a constant temperature and to refresh the water. The water is 
cleaned by a filter and UV-light. After each session the system will 
automatically be cleaned and no water is left behind. The product is 
produced by another Dutch manufacturer of bath- and shower systems. This 
patented shower system is ready now and sold in the Netherlands. The 
company is looking for cooperation with agents in other European countries 
for the sales and distribution of this product based on a commercial agency 
agreement.",The company is looking for an agent well known in the sanitation market .,"This Dutch SME is a specialist in wellness equipment for bathrooms. One of 
the products is a sustainable rain shower system. A rain shower uses a lot 
of water and requires much energy for heating. The company worked several 
years on the development of a sustainable rain shower . This is a cyclic

Sustainability: The showering system can save up to 90% on water, 
gas/electricity and reduces wastewater. This shower uses only 1-2 litres 
per minute and is 4 times more economical than the most water saving shower 
(6 litres) and provides 7 times more water, so the user is being rewarded 
for taking a sustainable shower. Also less waste water is produced. In the 
Netherlands, showering accounts for 43% of the total daily water 
consumption. This shower system makes it easy to reduce this water 
consumption percentage. The system enables in an easier way to realize a 
zero energy building. Hygiene: Showering under this system is completely 
hygienic. The water in the reservoir passes a (removable and easy to clean) 
micro filter, then the water runs through a UV lamp, which kills 
micro-organisms The product has a Dutch Kiwa certification. Cost: Many 
people like a comfortable daily shower, enjoying 40 litres of water per 
minute. Many people also want to save money. This shower system saves up to 
90 % in water and energy. This leads to a cost reduction for showering of 
90 %. Comfort: The shower system enables people to shower both sustainably 
and luxuriously. The system gives the luxury of 40 litres of water per 
minute splashing on ones body, in a more sustainable way than when using an 
economy shower, simply because only 1 to 2 litres of water per minute is 
used, instead of 40 litres. Installation: A smaller central heating boiler 
will suffice to enable this wellness experience. No larger piping or more 
water pressure required to achieve the same result.",Already on the market,"Design Rights,Patents granted,Trade Marks,Other",Dutch manufacturer of sustainable showers is looking for agents,Netherlands,http://www.tradeaccelerator.co.uk/country-guide/import-export-to-Netherlands,Supplier,OP10701,Import,Import-OP10701-Supplier-from-Netherlands,BONL20160629002,Enterprise Europe Network,Alibaba Alternative Supplier from Netherlands,Value Unknown

irregular corneas - The control of spherical aberration thanks to a 
high-definition aspheric design - A UV filter that filters 99% of UV-A and 
97% of UV-B, no micro-bubbles or 3/9 staining - No corneal erosion - A 
flexible wearing schedule enabling both daily and occasional wear - The

the detectors of changes in Earth's magnetic field. Thanks to that, the 
measurement efficiency does not depend on weather conditions (as is the 
case with video detection). The sensors' low power consumption makes it 
possible to power them with batteries. It is expected to operate for 5 
years without any breaks. Thanks to its small size, the device (sensor) is 
resistant to low-quality road base (contrary to the induction loops). Also 
the installation costs are reduced. The radio connection used for data 
transmission minimises the installation costs for the entire system. The 
sensor with such parameters is complex electronically but the result of 
works is a revolutionary product for detecting vehicles in traffic. It is 
perfect for spot detection in a single lane. Additionally, it is possible 
to detect the direction of vehicle movement. Thanks to the user-friendly 
hardware interface with Internet access to enable remote monitoring, the 
product is inexpensive, reliable and useful. This is the only detection 
system worldwide able to deliver information on vehicle and pedestrian 
traffic to the traffic light controller through a wireless route. In this 
way the crossroads can be updated without laying a single cable. This 
affects the price, installation duration and nuisance for traffic 
participants. The Integrated Detection System for Cars and Pedestrians is 
an effective alternative to existing vehicle detection systems, which are a 
key factor in intelligent transportation systems (ITS).",Already on the market,Secret Know-how,Polish SME offers efficient solution for smart city - the Integrated Detection System for cars and pedestrians.

system technology has recently launched a new line of products to appeal to 
a wide environmentally conscious audience seeking a modern looking product. 
The wall or ceiling mounted products are made from slimline materials, with 
touch screen controls that are simple to use and also to install. The infra 
red system is one of the most cost effective heating technologies currently 
available, efficiently converting electrical energy into far infra red 
heat. The CE certified products heat up immediately whilst having the 
facility to limit surface temperatures, making them suitable for care homes 
and nurseries, for example. With minimal maintenance – due to having no 
additional medium such as water involved - and emission-free, the heaters 
are healthier to use for allergy sufferers and have almost zero energy 
wastage, whilst reducing consumption up to 30% compared to the cost of 
electricity for example. Heaters and controls can be installed on a room 
only basis or as part of a wider heating system with variable thermostat 
controls for greater flexibility of heat distribution. Currently sold both 
in the UK and Europe to property developers, hoteliers, care homes and 
trade retailers, the products can be made to measure with regards to 
colour, shape and general customisation and work to a fifteen day 
turnaround from order to delivery. The company is now looking to expand 
into new markets overseas and seeks experienced distributors in the home 
products industry with a strong network of contacts in the private housing

system technology has recently launched a new line of products to appeal to 
a wide environmentally conscious audience seeking a modern looking product. 
The wall or ceiling mounted products are made from slimline materials, with 
touch screen controls that are simple to use and also to install. The infra 
red system is one of the most cost effective heating technologies currently 
available, efficiently converting electrical energy into far infra red 
heat. The CE certified products heat up immediately whilst having the 
facility to limit surface temperatures, making them suitable for care homes 
and nurseries, for example. With minimal maintenance – due to having no 
additional medium such as water involved - and emission-free, the heaters 
are healthier to use for allergy sufferers and have almost zero energy 
wastage, whilst reducing consumption up to 30% compared to the cost of 
electricity for example. Heaters and controls can be installed on a room 
only basis or as part of a wider heating system with variable thermostat 
controls for greater flexibility of heat distribution. Currently sold both 
in the UK and Europe to property developers, hoteliers, care homes and 
trade retailers, the products can be made to measure with regards to 
colour, shape and general customisation and work to a fifteen day 
turnaround from order to delivery. The company is now looking to expand 
into new markets overseas and seeks experienced distributors in the home 
products industry with a strong network of contacts in the private housing 
development, social housing and trade retail markets.","Below is a list of the current advantages and unique selling points of the 
company's systems and products: • All products are CE certified and come 
with five year warranty. • Up to twice as efficient as other heating 
systems . • Almost zero energy wastage and emission-free. • Instant heat – 
Infrared heating acts very quickly. • Customised heater designs – customers 
can design their own heater with a personal picture. • Easy to install – no 
pipework needed and minimal installation costs. • Flexible installation - 
either wall mounted or ceiling mounted dependent on space. • Flexible – 
solo use for difficult to heat rooms or as a whole heating system. • Zero 
maintenance – minimal parts. • Healthy – better for allergy sufferers, 
noise and odour free. • Smart – variable thermostats control heat in 
preferred areas. • No distributed heat losses (as found through central 
heating pipes) means less wasted energy. • Products have a very modern look

dashboard · Email alerts · On-screen manual The platform can be also easily 
extended with other features and functionalities. Based on platforms the 
company has also developed an interactive learning tool that supports the 
trainings of fundamental skills needed for a company's business. The 
training uses different types of media to impart knowledge and skills to a 
trainee like texts, pictures, videos, games and simulations. The lessons 
are built in a very structured format and allow the users to go through 
their content at an individual speed. At the same time, the software 
prevents skipping of the lessons. This ensures that all trainees have 
viewed the complete content without being able to take short-cuts. It also 
confirms the knowledge and skills of the trainee at the end by using 
multiple choice tests or different kinds of skills tests, respectively. If 
the test questions are answered incorrectly, the trainee needs to review 
the according sections before he can proceed with the training. Finally, 
the training can be easily customized to meet the individual requirements, 
extended with further functionalities, and branded for each client. The 
company is looking for the collaboration with various industries to jointly 
develop new IT solutions as well as support the digital transformation of 
various business processes. At the same time, the company possesses
